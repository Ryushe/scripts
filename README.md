# scripts
Some scripts I made to automate daily/boring tasks. In the process of moving pc's lost almost all so putting this here to make sure it doesn't happen again :sob:
 
## List:
Capstone:   
capstone_off - turns off vms (making sure they are correctly saved first)  
capstone_on - turns on all vms  
- Why? I got annoyed of having to manually turn on and off 6 machines lmao

Ngrok.bat - autmated mc ngrok config

mangamaker.sh - will send you to the dir where I automated creating manga. It sucked manually lmao

autocord.py - silly config to get unlimited discord loot boxes

worms launcher - ngrok -> public ip & launches the game 

installeverything... - script to set-up new linux boxes (sets up all my configs and such)

switch pro - nintendo is a dogshit company, so this removes/adds the bt connection so the controller can reconnect
- ya, so shitty that you cant RECONNECT once you dc
