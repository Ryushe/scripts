## Info
Some scripts I made to automate daily/boring tasks. In the process of moving pc's lost almost all so putting this here to make sure it doesn't happen again :sob:
 
## Open Apps
This program allows for the creation of a template script to move apps/chrome tabs around hyprsome's workspaces   

see more about it in its [readme](https://github.com/Ryushe/scripts/tree/main/open_apps)

## Capstone:   
capstone_off - turns off vms (making sure they are correctly saved first)  
capstone_on - turns on all vms  
- Why? I got annoyed of having to manually turn on and off 6 machines lmao

## Ngrok.bat 
automated mc ngrok config

## mangamaker.sh 
will send you to the dir where I automated creating manga. It sucked manually lmao

## autocord.py 
silly config to get unlimited discord loot boxes

## worms launcher 
ngrok -> public ip & launches the game 

## installeverything... 
script to set-up new linux boxes (sets up all my configs and such)

## switch pro 
nintendo is a terrible company, so this removes/adds the bt connection so the controller can reconnect
